# Dragon

A small static web project that displays a dragon demo using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository contains a single-page demo you can open locally to see the dragon visuals and interactions.

## Files

- `Dragon.html` — main HTML page. Open this in a browser to view the demo.
- `Dragon.css` — styles for the page and dragon visuals.
- `Dragon.js` — optional JavaScript used by the demo.

## How to run

Open the file directly (works for most demos):

	- Double-click `Dragon.html` or open it from your browser (File → Open File).


## Notes

- This is a simple static demo — no build step or dependencies are required unless you add packages.
- If you add assets or change script/module loading, prefer serving over the filesystem to avoid CORS/module issues.

## License

You can add a license file if you want to publish this project. For personal/demo projects, consider MIT.
